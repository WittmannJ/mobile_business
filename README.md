Collaborative App to create an Android App with firebase backend:

We have several different branches which correspond to the respective team members.
After the completion of the standard functionality we will create/ update the master branch with the most up-to-date version of all the individual branches.

Hopefully you just have to "git clone" this application to start using it.
